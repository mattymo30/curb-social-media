            <p>This is my project for Wafflehacks 2024!</p>
            <p>This project is something that has been on my mind about: stopping and reducing my use of social media. This allows you to block sites during parts of the day (or the whole day). Users can also set specific timers to focus on certain sites for a duration of time. Each blocked site will pop up a personal page where I programmed basic breathing exercises that the user can follow with to refocus!</p>
            <p>Future implementations past the hackathon include: full editing of sites already in storage, setting up sites to activate on certain days, and checking out statistics on their blocked sites.</p>
